## Agile console app
A simple console app to simulate agile way of work.

## Initialize
Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```
## Config
Before to initialize the app you need to set up some config variables. For that you have to create a file called .env in the root of the project:
```
DB_PATH = "./nameOfTheDirectory"
DB_FILE_PATH = "./nameOfTheDirectory/fileName.json"
```
After this configuration you'll be able to run the app.

## First run
Once that you have installed the dependencies and configured the .env file, to initialize the app you can use two commands:
```
npm start
node app
```
